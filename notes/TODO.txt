SOLVABLE BUGS:

inventory_add_item will go into endless loop when you add more items than the inventory can hold
collisions for player doesnt work when spaceship is rotating

mouse is too fine due to zooming
	need to scale up x4


WEIRD BUGS:



TODO additions

Component connection placement
	
components connect to walls not hull


Tools
	Drills
		- deleting walls, hull, components
		- Higher tiers destroy faster and more higher tiered blocks
	Wrench
		- For configuring inputs and outputs and for linking components together
	
Interctions with components
	Control panel controls connected components
	Engines need fuel
	

	
Player hotbar









TOTO tweaks:
Inventory Hover barrier sprite lighting using subimages instead of rotated sprite
Highight attachments that can be activated
